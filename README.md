# üèê Volleyball Game
- This is a small game that we made to learn unity and get used to its environment.
- It's a simple volleyball game where 2 players need to kick the ball into the other's side of the court.
- It's physics based with unity's built-in gravity.
- You can play with 2 players or against a bot that's been trained with ML agent.
- We were inspired from [Ultimate Volleyball](https://towardsdatascience.com/ultimate-volleyball-a-3d-volleyball-environment-built-using-unity-ml-agents-c9d3213f3064) 
where the bot agent was trained. We then improved the training-suitable environment to a gameplay-suitable environment.


- You can download the game from [itch.io](https://malloumario.itch.io/volley-ball-game)
- There are still few known bugs here and there but overall it's in a playable state.
- Through this game we learnt:
   - Writing c# scripts using unity fonctions
   - How animations work
   - 3d modeling in Unity
   - Different interactions between game objects
   - Modding textures and materials
   - Managing scenes
   - Adding sfx and music
   - Working with UI elements
